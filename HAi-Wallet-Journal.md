# HAi Wallet Development Journal

## Project Kickoff

**Date:** 17-07-2025 

### 1. Brainstorming & Core Concept
- HAi Wallet is positioned as the "cursor of web3 wallets"—a modular, AI-integrated, user-friendly crypto wallet.
- Key features: Google/Email/Traditional wallet creation, import, contact book, AI agent for transaction abstraction, three control modes (Full, Semi, Agent), and a focus on non-technical users.

### 2. Tech Stack Approval
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js (PWA), Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit/Zustand, Ethers.js/Viem
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Firebase/Auth0, OpenAI API or custom LLM
- **Security:** HSM, AES-256, TLS 1.3
- **Architecture:** Modular, plug-in, monorepo structure for maximum flexibility

### 3. Project Structure Scaffolded
- Created the following structure:

```

### 4. Version Control Initialized
- Initialized a new git repository in the project root for version control and collaboration.

**All further steps, decisions, and architectural changes will be documented here as the project progresses.** 

---

### 5. Interface Templates: Authentication & Wallet Management Layer
- Created and documented modular interface templates for:
  - Auth Service (Google OAuth, Email/Password, Traditional Wallet Creation, Import Wallet)
  - Wallet Factory (Key Generation, Multi-signature Support, Wallet Recovery)
  - Profile Management (Key Storage, Contact Book, Security Settings)
- All interfaces are designed for plug-in compatibility and future extensibility.

**Next step:** Begin interface design for the AI Agent Core components. 

---

### 6. Interface Templates: AI Agent Core & Control System Manager
- Created and documented modular interface templates for:
  - AI Agent Core (Prompt Parser, Transaction Builder, Safety Layer)
  - Control System Manager (Control Mode Switcher, Full Control UI, Semi Control UI, Agent Control)
- All interfaces are designed for plug-in compatibility and future extensibility.

**Next step:** Begin interface design for the Transaction Engine components. 

---

### 7. Interface Review: Authentication & Wallet Management Layer
- Conducted a detailed, section-by-section review of all interfaces for Authentication & Wallet Management Layer.
- Verified coverage, extensibility, and security for:
  - Auth Service
  - Wallet Factory
  - Profile Management
- Section approved with no changes required.

**Next section under review:** AI Agent Core interfaces. 

---

### 8. Interface Review: AI Agent Core
- Conducted a detailed, section-by-section review of all interfaces for the AI Agent Core.
- Verified coverage, extensibility, and security for:
  - Prompt Parser
  - Transaction Builder
  - Safety Layer
- Section approved with no changes required.

**Next section under review:** Control System Manager interfaces. 

---

### 9. Interface Review: Control System Manager
- Conducted a detailed, section-by-section review of all interfaces for the Control System Manager.
- Verified coverage, extensibility, and security for:
  - Control Mode Switcher
  - Full Control UI
  - Semi Control UI
  - Agent Control
- Section approved with no changes required.

**Next section under review:** Transaction Engine interfaces. 

---

### 10. Interface Review: Transaction Engine
- Conducted a detailed, section-by-section review of all interfaces for the Transaction Engine.
- Verified coverage, extensibility, and security for:
  - Transfer Module
  - Bridge Module
  - Swap Module
  - Multi-chain Support
- Section approved with no changes required.

**All interface templates for the core architecture have now been finalized and approved.**

---

### Next Phase of Development
- Scaffold and implement the core plugin system (plugin loader/manager) for both backend and frontend, enabling dynamic registration and discovery of modules.
- Set up shared types, enums, and utility functions in the `packages/types` and `packages/core` directories for consistency across all modules.
- Initialize the Next.js PWA frontend and backend API (Node.js/Express or FastAPI) with the modular structure.
- Begin implementing the first set of core modules (e.g., Google OAuth, basic wallet creation, simple transfer) using the finalized interfaces.
- Write unit and integration tests for the plugin system and initial modules.
- Document the plugin system and provide clear guidelines for creating, registering, and using plugins.

**Ready to proceed to plugin system scaffolding or another next step as directed.**
