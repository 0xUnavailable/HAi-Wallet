# HAi Wallet Project Journal

## Recent Updates (2024-06)

### Universal Mainnet & Testnet Support
- **Transfers and swaps are now fully supported on all major EVM mainnets and testnets:**
  - Ethereum (Mainnet, Sepolia)
  - Optimism (Mainnet, Optimism Sepolia)
  - Arbitrum (Mainnet, Arbitrum Sepolia)
  - Base (Mainnet, Base Sepolia)
- **Prompt-driven selection:** Users can specify any of these networks in their transfer or swap prompt, e.g.:
  - "Transfer 0.01 ETH to 0x... on Optimism"
  - "Swap 10 USDC to ETH on Base Sepolia"

### Token Registry Improvements
- **Token registry now supports all these networks for native ETH and major ERC20s (WETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, etc).**
- **Permanent fallback:** If a user requests a native ETH transfer or swap on any EVM-compatible network (even if not explicitly listed), the registry will always return a valid native ETH token info object.
- **Explicit entries** for Base mainnet, Base Sepolia, Arbitrum Sepolia, and Optimism Sepolia have been added for both native ETH and major ERC20s.
- **Extensible:** Adding a new network or token to the registry instantly enables it for both transfers and swaps.
- **All swap and transfer operations now resolve token symbols (ETH, WETH, USDC, USDT, etc.) to their canonical contract addresses for the selected network before making any DEX or transfer API call.**
- **The token registry is the single source of truth for all token addresses and network configs, and is used by both gas and gasless swap APIs as well as transfers.**
- **This ensures all DEX and transfer operations are robust, accurate, and future-proof for any supported network or token.**

### Wallet Manager & DEX API Integration
- **walletManager.ts** now recognizes and operates on all supported mainnets and testnets, with correct RPC URLs and block explorers.
- **SwapDEXAPIPlugin and GaslessDEXAPIPlugin** both use the shared token registry for all token and network lookups.
- **TransferAPIPlugin** also uses the same registry, ensuring consistent behavior across all features.

### Cross-Network Transfers & Swaps
- **Users can now transfer or swap tokens between any supported network, mainnet or testnet, using a single prompt.**
- **No code changes required:** If a new network or token is added to the registry, it is instantly available for both transfers and swaps.
- **All features are prompt-driven and modular, with no hardcoded network or token logic.**

### Summary
- The HAi Wallet now provides seamless, extensible, and prompt-driven support for all major EVM networks and tokens, for both transfers and swaps.
- The architecture is future-proof: new networks and tokens can be added in one place (the registry) and are immediately available everywhere.
